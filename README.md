# Introduction to Model Checking with Spin

(under construction)

I used to give a semester-long course on model checking. For now, I pull out three short introductions to model checking that can be read independently and present the topic from different angles.

- For a highlevel introduction, I like [Model Checking: A Tutorial Overview](https://members.loria.fr/SMerz/papers/mc-tutorial.pdf) by Stephan Merz. I wrote a short meta-tutorial with exercises and code in [Model Checking the Needham-Schroeder Protocol](notes/needham-schroeder.md).
- For a hands-on introduction to the workings of Spin I present how Spin can be used for path-finding and solving the ... puzzle.
- For a more indepth analysis of a classic example of concurrency theory ...

I also have an [introduction to the introductions](Introduction) at 
The official webpages of [Spin](https://spinroot.com/spin/whatispin.html) have much information of general interest (highly recommended).

To follow the exercises, you need to install Spin. Last time I followed the [instalation instructions](https://spinroot.com/spin/whatispin.html) I took the following steps (on macos): 

```
brew install spin
```
